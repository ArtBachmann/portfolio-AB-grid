  Sustainable Development in Information and Communication Technology. Introduction. This essay disserts how information and
  communication technology (ICT) is related with sustainable development. Mankind is going through one of the biggest changes
  in history. The digital progress is revolutionizing the way we interact, live, work and the way we communicate. At the
  same time growing consciousness of the sustainability challenges threatening our planet is urging us to ask thoughtful
  questions about our economy and lifestyles. The phrase "sustainable development" is a recent invention, coming into accepted
  usage lately. The Brundtland -led World Commission on Environment and Development report Our Common Future, published in
  1987, gave this new concept an official definition: “to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability
  of future generations to meet their own needs".The development of low-cost and brand-new information and communications
  technologies and the appearance of information society with new economic standards has the potential for making major improvements
  towards sustainability of the earth’s ecosystems. The idea of an information society has a huge potential to solve the
  dilemma of sustainable development, which is: Providing quality of life to all people without overusing the ecosystem.
  Nowadays information society is relying on technology, knowledge and intelligence. Information technology provide people
  and ICT systems with information which is transformed into know-how and understanding. IT with communications technologies
  simplify fast, affordable and resource efficient approach to information, learning possibilities and support tools for
  its citizens. Innovative use of information technology offers less resource-intensive production, consumption and services.
  Such changes can notably reduce the environmental impact of industrial and commercial activities and contribute to sustainable
  development. Danziger and Andersen define Information Technology (IT) as those mechanical, conceptual, human and organizational
  components whose function is to transmit or store data and information using digital devices. Information and communication
  Technologies (ICT) encompass all those technologies that enable the handling of information and facilitate different forms
  of communication among human actors, between human beings and electronic systems, and among electronic system .If we develop
  and implement ICT wrong, it could worsen the world’s problems such are wasting energy, quicken the climate change and increase
  pollution. Is possible that it also leads to more furious consumerism. One social problem may be that ITC will increase
  inequality for those who do not have access to modern techniques. On the other hand applying ICT well the bonuses may be
  huge for society. They may occur for example helping solve people´s problems with enhancing creativity and innovation and
  provide for more peoples access to services, goods and use of valuable resources more efficiently. We have the potency
  to guard social and economic benefits through our choices on how we produce, use and handle ICT. These assets might include
  energy savings with monitoring and controlling energy use, modernizing transport systems so there will be better fuel economy.
  Making ICT more useful will enable people to do more with less and using ICT more efficiently will diminish the impact
  of the manufacturing stage. This may be something like that as buying a new PC after four years instead of two. For example
  when user is utilizing his/her PC for four years instead of two then already need for producing new machine is lessen fifty
  per cent. And when it is possible to share one device among multiple users reduces again the impact from manufacturing
  new office or home appliances. It is obvious that the PC manufacturing industry is not interested of reducing their production
  and also profit at the same time. But there is not another way to do more with less as the worlds population is growing
  and more and more people want and can afford new technological equipment for themselves as their expectations are increasing.
  There is possible when using ICT to move away from business model which is based on material products and rely more on
  different services other entrepreneurs can offer. For example there is possible to rent a use of the office appliances
  instead of buying them after every couple of years. This means that every small or middle sized company do not need spend
  a lot of money for it`s own database machine when it needs one. Instead it can rent virtual space on service providers
  database server and use and pay for it only as much it is used and exact what services company has ordered or how much
  traffic it uses. Companies need less expensive physical devices or making long journeys. These are replaced with digital
  alternatives. People need what computers help them to do not the computers itself. ICT can aid to trim the environmental
  footprint of what people do. The digital revolution could spread welfare to all parts of society and all places of the
  world. It can bring benefits to every location, disability and age. Threats to ecosystem. The objective of creating a sustainable
  world is a undeniable. The overwhelming scientific testimony is that most ecosystem services are currently being depraved
  or used not sustainably. UN’s Environment Program says that: “Human activity is putting such strain on the natural functions
  of the Earth that the ability of the planet’s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted.
  Many of these ecosystem services are at or beyond limits. Not only rain forests and polar bears that are under threat.
  Water resources, agriculture and climatic systems are all under risk to be destroyed. Our current pathway of development
  is bringing us up against environmental limits and this could lead to disaster. We’re also reduce our natural resources
  every time when our demands are growing. The planet is likely to be 9.7 billion inhabitant in 2050 and 11.2 billion in
  2100, according to a new UN DESA report, “World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision” , with near a billion more people
  in the next 10 years . And just like citizens in the developed countries want to drive their cars and buy new clothes,
  so people in developing countries want that too. We face the double challenge of decreasing inequality between rich and
  poor nations and having fewer resources to deal with growing consumption of raw materials . The information and communication
  technology (ICT) companies needs to be more familiar of the risks and opportunities associated to sustainability issues.
  It is exactly in the concern of ICT industry to identify the long term environmental and social profits of sustainable
  business process. If this industry wants to stay alive in a speedily changing world it has to adapt with awareness and
  inspiration. By better understanding the alliance between ICT and the sustainability debate, companies can use new technology
  in the ways that bring actual profits. ICT is invented by manufacturing and service companies whose products transmit or
  present data and information electronically. At the present time a a lot of the research targets on the influences and
  opportunities created by the existence of ICT and the industry’s proceedings and development. These include the verification,construction,
  design and disposal of ICT. Communications technologies are exploding. In 2013, the number of smart phones sold to consumers
  stood at over 967 million units, an increase of over fifty percent on the figure from 2011. This means that almost 20 percent
  of the world’s total population owned a smart device in 2013, a figure that is expected to increase to 34 percent by 2017.
  In the same year smart phone penetration is set to reach 62.2 percent in North America and 65.8 percent in western Europe
  This is a large rise in the 29.3 percent of people in North America and 22.7 percent of Western Europeans who had smart
  phones in 2011. Consumers usually see computer as a piece of plastic and metal on the desk. We usually don` t think about
  the large amounts of earth and gravel used in manufacturing, the associated extermination or damage to biodiversity, and
  the enormous volumes of energy required in the extraction and refinement process. Usually non-renewable resources are involved
  in production and sometimes toxic chemicals are used to extract the metals from the ores and toxic nature of some of the
  materials mined.. There is always a threat to the air pollution and groundwater . A United Nations University study into
  the environmental influence of personal computers, has found that around 1.8 tons of raw material are required to manufacture
  the average desktop PC and monitor. This is about equal of a mid-sized car. Study also found that lengthening a machine's
  operational life through re-use holds a much greater potential for energy saving than recycling. Moreover , the manufacturing
  of a one desktop computer and 17-inch monitor needs minimally 240 kilos of fossil fuels, 22 kilos of chemicals and 1,500
  kilos of water. Also about 100 kg. mine is required to get gold for a single circuit board. The next step in the process
  is manufacturing what includes several computer components like keyboards, screens, batteries, circuit boards which are
  usually manufactured in different locations and even in other countries and continents by various companies. Researches
  show that the energy used to mass-produce components is is the most critical impact. How much water used is important especially
  depending on the location. About 45.5 liters of water is required mainly for washing as producing one average computer
  chip. Some materials are possibly hazardous during production, for example toxic metals in batteries such as cadmium and
  lithium, lead in cathode ray tubes and many more. Incompetent waste treatment facilities can lead to consequent environmental
  damage. Throwing away things wastes resources. It wastes the raw materials and energy used in making the items and it wastes
  money. Reducing waste means less environmental impact, less resources and energy used and saves money. Global manufacturing
  and out-sourcing bring to ICT industry many advantages. The capability to find out cheaper suppliers increases competition,
  lowers prices and can help deliver stability of supply and new markets. There are however additional problems involved.
  Developing countries are a far behind in progress , with different standards and other commercial and cultural existence.
  Quality control, trace-ability and accountability can be difficult to maintain in extended sustainable supply chain management.
  There are potentialities to completely improve how ICT is made and disposed of. The management can reduce the energy intensity
  of manufacturing and boost its efficiency. It can take advantage of more renovated parts and recycled material and use
  less probably hazardous materials. One major source material for ICT products is copper. Copper has never been more important
  for the sustainable growth of modern society. Copper based products improve the economic efficiency and environmental performance
  of multiple applications across the energy, health care, IT, industrial, transportation and building sectors. EU places
  more and more priority on the “green technologies” needed to meet its 2020 energy targets, it is progressively essential
  to understand the life cycles of the underlying raw materials. Engineers go on to explore new ways to build products that
  are both more resource efficient and distribute better performance. The copper industry can continue the innovations that
  will drive EU competitiveness, boost economic growth while reducing energy losses and fight climate change and reduce the
  environmental influence of resource utilization. Lessening the relative impact of ICT for instance reducing the impact
  from making one PC by 20% is significant. Although given the projected rise in requirement it is as important to lessen
  demand for ICT hardware and software. For instance, doubling the life of a PC would reduce the impact from manufacturing
  a PC by 50%. If that same PC is shared with one other individual the impact would be halved again, completely reducing
  the effect from making one PC by 75%. Lengthening a device` s operational life through re-use holds a much more potential
  for energy saving than recycling. Donating an aged machine so that it may continue to be used, can produce likely energy
  savings of between five and 20 times those achieved by recycling. EPEAT is a free and trusted source of environmental product
  ratings that makes it easy to select high-performance electronics that support organizations・IT and sustainability goals.
  The system began in 2003 with a stakeholder process assembled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and has grown
  to be the actual global environmental rating system for electronics. Managed by the Green Electronics Council, EPEAT presently
  tracks more than 4,400 products from more than 60 manufacturers across 43 countries. EPEAT currently includes product ratings
  for PCs and Displays (including tablets), Imaging Equipment ( including printers, copiers, scanners and multifunction devices)
  and Televisions. Environmental leadership standards are currently under development with the intent to form the basis of
  future EPEAT categories for Mobile Phones, Servers and other electronic products. A non-fiduciary Advisory Councilprovides
  input and advice about EPEAT expansion and other relevant issues.) In the year 2013 information and technology ecosystem
  stand for about 10 per cent of the world's electricity generation, and it's hungry for coal. Analyst firm Digital Power
  Group has synthesized plentiful reports and presented data on the actual electricity utilization of our digital world.
  In "The Cloud Begins With Coal – Big Data, Big Networks, Big Infrastructure, and Big Power", the research team dispute
  that much of the charge of our digital world is buried from us because of the distant nature of cloud services and the
  absence of information about the power it takes to make our IT machinery. Although charging up a tablet or smart phone
  requires a trivial load of electricity, using one of two to look an hour of video in a week expends every year more electricity
  in the networks than two new refrigerators annually. This precedent uses publicly accessible data on the average power
  utilization of a telco network, the cost of wireless network infrastructure, and the energy that goes into making a tablet,
  although it ignores the data centers the video is served out of, and tablet charging. Looking at the full life cycle of
  ICT, the using phase is the most important in terms of energy use, waste production and greenhouse gas emissions. The consistent
  evolution of ICT technology cut down device lifetimes. New models of computer, phones and server applications are released,
  growing ambition and utilization. ICT equipment are not the only sector where this happens- the same may be noticed with
  other consumer goods such as clothes. Here are some electronic waste facts that are interesting and alarming: · We generate
  around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year, worldwide. That’s like throwing 800 laptops every second. · An average
  cellphone user replaces their unit once every 18 months. · E-waste comprises 70% of our overall toxic waste. · Only 12.5%
  of E-Waste is recycled. · 85% of our E-Waste are sent to landfills and incinerators are mostly burned, and release harmful
  toxins in the air! · Electronics contain lead which can damage our central nervous system and kidneys. · A child’s mental
  development can be affected by low level exposure to lead. · The most common hazardous electronic items include LCD desktop
  monitors, LCD televisions, Plasma Televisions, TVs and computers with Cathode Ray Tubes. · E-waste contains hundreds of
  substances, of which many are toxic. This includes mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, chromium, and flame retardants.
  · 80% of E-Waste in the US and most of other countries are transported to Asia. · 300 million computers and 1 billion cellphones
  go into production annually. It is expected to grow by 8% per year. Behavior Change and Efficiency. There is no two ways
  about it – the world` s technologies must going to have to get more efficient. In order to reduce the shock of climate
  change, all countries must lessen their emissions substantially. Some improvements can be done from simple behavior changes.
  For example less computers and other devices must not be powered on when they are not in use. Usually many commercially
  used ICT systems are forbidden from entering their standby mode , meaning that many PC-s and systems run at entire power
  regularly. One way to reduce the impact of consumers equipment is to recharge batteries with renewable electricity. For
  example in the market there are several different solar chargers for mobile phones, tablets, GPS units and even for notebooks
  and their cooling systems which keep notebook chilled and makes the power last longer. Solar chargers is especially useful
  when needed wherever user is (only light is needed of course). This is straight way between energy source and client. But
  exists also other green electricity types which means it is produced from sources which do not cause impacts upon the environment
  like pollution of carbon dioxide and using nuclear power. One of these alternatives are wind power with wind turbines sited
  in suitable locations many of them built at sea which is increasing method. Wind turbine technology has vastly moved on
  over the last ten years, making wind turbines quieter and more efficient so that electricity generated from the wind is
  now often competitive with traditional coal-fired and nuclear power stations. Solar power in a massive production uses
  solar photo voltaic (PV) module which works by converting sunlight directly into electric. The majority of solar modules
  available today use ‘waste’ silicon from the computer chip industry as the semiconductor material. They can be integrated
  into buildings and even made into roof tiles virtually indistinguishable from normal tiles. Hydro power is used to produce
  electricity for over 100 years. Stations may be in very different sizes from really huge to smallest like which work as
  a 'run of the river' system which has a minimal impact on the local environment. Wave power is next huge energy resource
  and many various devices have been constructed over the years to capture some of this. Tidal energy, sometimes named tidal
  power, is the power produced by capturing the energy enclosed in moving water in tides open ocean currents. There are two
  types of tidal energy systems that can be used to extract energy, the moving water of rivers, tides and open ocean currents
  and potential energy from the difference in height between high and low tides. Their way is to use marine current turbines,
  which work like underwater wind turbines, utilize tidal currents rather of the winds. Each of two agricultural wastes or
  especially grown plants can be used as a biomass material to run modest power stations. When plants grow they consume carbon
  dioxide (the primary gas guilty for climate change) which is then discharged when the plants are burnt. Using biomass does
  not add any extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Especially grown 'energy crops' provide not only an environmentally
  sound source of electricity, but also an significant new opportunity for farmers. Landfill gas is produced when trash decomposes
  in the junkyard sites where our everyday waste is unloaded, it gives off methane gas. This gas can be captured and burnt
  in a gas turbine to produce electricity. Burning the gas gives off carbon dioxide but since methane, which is emitted from
  the landfill site, is in fact a much more powerful greenhouse gas it is preferred to burn it than to allow the methane
  to disappear into the atmosphere. Geothermal energy comes from hot rocks deep underground. In some parts of the world steam
  comes to the surface and can be used to run steam turbines to produce electricity directly. In other places water can be
  pumped down and heated by the rocks to make steam. Geothermal energy can also be used to provide hot water and heating
  for buildings. It’s no secret that data centers expend huge amounts of energy. Between powering and cooling all the devices
  found in a data center, among other things servers, networking gear, and storage, a lot of electricity and money goes into
  managing our digital world. Which are the possibilities to make data centers less power hungry?One elementary solution
  is switching the type of power supply, can have powerful impacts on energy consumption during procedure. Company has to
  switch from alternative current (AC) power to direct current (DC) power. Another possibility is to change hard drives to
  flash memory in corporation cashing servers. One low-energy cooling concept uses cold air from the outside. One helpful
  method is to adopt universal open standards. There are a too much of schemes and standards in the ICT industry and this
  can make consumer` s lives painful. The diversity of standards also encourages excessive consumption of ICT goods. Regular
  updates of software that can’t run on older PCs is unsustainable. Unified accepted standards would decrease consumption
  and help to make the use of ICT applications easier for users. ICT can be used at all levels, from the development of supply
  chains to the auditing of office systems such as air conditioning. Over 50% of the developed countries CO2 emissions come
  from the built environment. There is extensive potential to save materials through more rational process control. Industry
  should endorse a conversion not only from products to services but also to services that are progressively environmentally
  safe. In agriculture ICT embedding technology is being used to help to reduce waste, water, energy and chemicals. ICT could
  lead in a whole new way of exchanging goods and services. The world have already seen the possibilities of this with the
  outstanding success of eBay. In future we could see progressively more people sharing products directly, using ICT to communicate.
  Examples of this are peer - topeer music file sharing and The Freecycle Network. Freecycle s a nonprofit organization and
  it organizes a worldwide network of "gifting" groups to divert reusable goods from junkyard. The network administers a
  worldwide online registry, regulates the creation of local groups and forums for individuals and nonprofits to offer and
  receive free items for reuse or recycling and to promote a gift economy There are sustainability benefits in such actions
  like connecting an unifying people , more possibilities to recycle and reuse different products. There may be some shortcomings
  like more transportation of goods, ascending of packaging and may be also stimulation for more consumerism. Sustainable
  and Ubiquitous Computing. How does the future look like? In 20 years computers will surely be much more capable than they
  are today perhaps by as much as a thousand times. We can also predict accelerated developments in a range of different
  areas of technology, from nano materials with new properties and new ways of generating and storing energy to artificial
  intelligence, robotics, genetics and medicine. Research and improvement activity is already focusing massively on these
  areas. What is much less sure is how technological improvements will be adapted into products and applications , and how
  people will want to benefit them. We will also see more pervasive computing. Myriad miniature computers with powerful processing
  capacity will be linked by mega-bandwidth wireless networks, ushering in the era of the “always on” internet. This is already
  happening. Electronic travel card can talk to the ticket barrier on the bus and mobile phone have high-speed mobile broadband
  4G LTE, motion sensors and mobile payment features. RFID chips are distributed and embedded in everything - our clothes,
  our pets, our groceries and under our skin. Companies and governments will receive fast, detailed feedback on many aspects
  of our lives. There are a lot of questions as to what pervasive computing will mean for personal privacy. Because of this,
  we will have to be wary not to aggravate the digital divide. This term refers to economic and social inequality with regard
  to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT). It is unsure if the digital divide
  is simply a reinforcement of already existing patterns of social segregation. On a global scale, Over the next 10 years,
  much of internet` s growth will come from emerging nations like Brazilian, Indian and Chinese. In fact, there is not much
  potential for growth in North America, which is close to saturation point, with an internet penetration of over 80%. Africa
  has the lowest internet penetration of just under 10%, and is also likely to see the biggest growth. Asia has a penetration
  of around 25%, and will witness a strong growth as well, especially in countries like India, where the internet is all
  set to take off in a big way. Sustainable working. Information technologies can support us to work smarter. This means
  lesser wasted time and fewer wasted resources. ICT can help lessen energy and resource use, increase environmental productivity
  and lead to more productive ways of doing business. There is an tremendous shift taking place in the economy, from industrial
  production to service-based, knowledge demanding industries. As requirements for products and services has become unpredictable
  and markets have become global, the system of mass production has become too inflexible and pricey to sustain. Large companies
  have accepted new business models - usually subcontracting to small and medium-sized businesses. Their flexibility grants
  productivity gains for the large companies as well as for the economy as a whole. These “network organizations” depend
  on a immense number of connections between smaller companies, where the relations can easily be broken and re-made in a
  precise period of time. Teleworking, sometimes called telecommuting, means working from home using modern technology to
  keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be positioned to places where it is more attractive, pleasant or cheaper to
  live. Because of the Internet and the ability to communicate with the company network from anywhere in the world, many
  employees now work part time or full time from home. However, it has not become mainstream by any means. Most useful about
  teleworking is that It is estimated that the average person spends around 4 hours drive to work each week. That is a lot
  of time sitting in a car or train! Workers at home can use fast networks, real-time video feeds, email, instant messaging,
  secure connections and so on. But a survey by Telework Research Network marked that only 2.5% (3 million people) recognized
  home to be their main place of work (excluding self-employed or unpaid volunteers) and yet in a CBI survey in 2011 a total
  of 59% of employers offer teleworking as a choice - up from 13% in 2006. This all leads to more sustainable and greener
  working environment. Sustainable Traveling. Will virtual traffic replace real traffic? ICT could help create more dynamic
  logistics and distribution systems. It could also give handicapped consumers easier access to goods and services. On the
  other hand, it might mean more delivery operations, more extended supply chains and longer carriage distances. By 2020
  EU truck traffic is expected to increase by another 20%. Businesses and government are therefore increasingly looking into
  high-tech solutions for supply chain logistics and warehouse technologies. More commonly, e-commerce and travel might not
  undoubtedly result in lower consumer emissions. For example, despite customer visits to the shops may be decreased, the
  goods still have to be transported to the customer. What might once have been one shopping trip could be turned into tree
  independent deliveries. ICT can diminish the need to travel in the first place. As electronic communications improve, people
  will progressively be able to practice ‘being there’ without having to maneuver. Telematics can link global positioning
  satellites (GPS) to traffic-flow systems. Benefits from telematics include increased productivity, consignments efficiency
  and enhanced customer service. It incorporates also vehicle, driver and cargo safety. A new technology known as Virtual
  Traffic Lights (VTL) was freshly suggested as a self-organizing new paradigm for traffic administration. This new technology
  benefits the vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications as its premise. VTL can revolutionize traffic management in urban
  areas as it can essentially reduce drive time of urban workers, boost productivity, and lead to a greener environment.
  In a VTL environment, vehicles self-organize to resolve a leader which serves as a virtual traffic light to elect the right
  of way at that intersection, thus replacing the ongoing physical traffic lights. Effectuating VTL technology with partial
  penetration is an exceptional issue that needs to be addressed. The coexistence model is inspired by the High Occupancy
  Vehicle (HOV) lane paradigm whereby some lanes on a highway, for instance, are reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles
  carrying passengers. While trucks contribute more than three-quarters of inland transport, shipment by train have been
  estimated to be approximately three times as energy efficient as road transportation . Progressive delivery schemes for
  long distances ( over ~500 kilometers) cut fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions by 65%, compared to truck transport. Conclusions.
  The ICT industry faces remarkably complicated sustainability challenges. However, as this paper demonstrates, there are
  also a number of opportunities to deal with them. If these are exploited adequately, the ICT sector will become more sustainable
  and can support other sectors, industries and basically the consumer to play their part. Evidently, how we use ICT is essential
  to the sustainability potential of ICT products and services. Evidentally, how we use ICT is essential to the sustainability
  potential of ICT products and services. The use of toxic materials during production of ICT products must be decreased.
  But the problem remains if the lifetime of the products is so short like today – two years. ICT has the scope to commit
  to global economic growth via developing accessibility and lower pricing. However, this welfare will be of little effect
  if the challenges of improving working practices, use phases and processes are not take care of. Engaging with the consumer
  can be a sophisticated activity for businesses. This is also true of assimilate sustainable ICT solutions into business
  models. But both must be done if maximum benefit is to be realized. For every business in all regions and for every aspect
  of sustainable ICT, the ordinary level of maturity is small and substantial opportunity for progress remains. References.
